\section{Changes in sn version 2.1.1 (2023-04-04)}{
  \itemize{
  \item Coding of \code{pst} is improved for extreme \code{x} arguments
    by employing asymptotic expressions of tail probabilites. 
    As an implication, this change improves the working of \code{qst}.
    Also, new arguments \code{lower.tail} and \code{log.p} are added.
  \item 
    Checking on the dimensionality \code{(d,m)} of calls to \code{{d,p}sun, 
    sunMean, sunVcov, sunMardia} takes place before a call to a function of 
    \pkg{mnormt} is issued. If the maximal dimensionality is exceeded, either 
    a \code{stop} is generated, or \code{NA}s are returned, 
    depending on the value of the \code{silent} argument.
  \item
    Fixed bugs affecting calls to \code{psn, pst} when \code{length(x)} was
    shorter than the length of the parameters (among \code{xi, omega, alpha}).
  }
}

\section{Changes in sn version 2.1.0 (2022-07-30)}{
  \itemize{
    \item New function \code{fitdistr.grouped}, with pertaining class and methods.
    \item More informative messages are issued when \code{trace=TRUE}, at several places.
    \item An experimental way for initializing the parameters of \code{sn.mple} 
          fitting is introduced; it only takes effect when it improves over 
	  the existing scheme. 
    \item Some adjustments in the documenation on request of the CRAN group.
    \item Fixed a bug affecting \code{st.prelimFit} when the argument \code{w}
          was used.

       matrix \code{y}.
    \item In \code{psn}, improved handling of non-finite \code{x} values 
      \code{(NA, NaN, Inf)}, which led to crashes; 
      also, streamlined coding of \code{qsn}. 
    \item Minor fixes in the documentation of zeta and qsn; improved wording elsewhere.

      (i) using classic-style functions for probability distributions, 
         plus some functions of similar style;
      (ii) using S4 objects of the new class \code{SUNdistr}. 
      For mode (i), the functions \code{{d,p,r}sun, sun{Mean,Vcov,Mardia}} are provided. 
      For mode (ii), there are \code{{make, marginal, conditional, affineTrans, join, 
      convolution, summary}SUNdistr}, and related S4 methods.
