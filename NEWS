R package 'sn' NEWS (ChangeLog) file
------------------------------------

Version 1.2-4 (2015-08-25)
Output of plot.SECdistr is better structured and documented. In pmst, handling
of case nu=Inf required a fix. Corrected a bug of internal function msn.dp2dp 
when called with aux=TRUE and d=1; this affected rmsn and rmst with d=1.

Version 1.2-3 (2015-07-14)
Fixed a bug in evaluation of the feasible CP parameter space of univariate ST.
Fixed a bug which crashed pmst when called with fractional degrees of freedom.
Functions dmsn, pmsn and dmst now expand a single value supplied as 'xi' into
a vector or matrix of suitable dimension.

Version 1.2-2 (2015-06-05)
Fixed a bug in extractSECdistr from mselm-class objects. Fixed a bug that 
prevented calling low level fitting functions with non-null 'penalty' argument.
Improved documentation of selm.fit and related functions.

Version 1.2-1 (2015-04-28)
Optimization parameters are now passed from selm to sn.mple and st.mple as
indicated in the documentation. Plotting of selm-class and mselm-class objects
avoids clash of par('cex') parameters. Computation of sn.infoMv now takes into
account whether method="MPLE" was used at the estimation stage. 

Version 1.2-0 (2015-03-24)
Created new functions extractSECdistr and modeSECdistr; new methods mean and 
sd for class SECdistrUv and new methods mean and vcov for class SECdistrMv.
Computation of qst switches to qsn if nu>1e4, instead of nu=Inf as before.
Fixed a bug in st.pdev.hessian (correction in args sequence). Improved 
detection of singular distributions in selm output.  Improved handling of 
component names of SECdistr.
	
Version 1.1-2 (2014-11-30)
Fixed a bug affecting plotting of mselm-class objects under certain 
circumstances. Fixed a bug affecting function selm when the weights argument 
contained some 0's. Improved coding in some functions. More functions are
exported and their documentation added.

Version 1.1-1 (2014-10-30)
Function qsn has an additional argument 'solver'. Functions pmsn and pmst can 
now be called with argument 'xi' of matrix type. More functions are now 
exported in NAMESPACE. Fixed a bug about selm.control argument of selm.fit. 
Improved documentation of various functions.

Version 1.1-0 (2014-08-06)
Main few feature is the possibility to set the constraint alpha=0 in function 
selm and in lower level fitting functions. Other additions or changes are:
introduction of OP parameterization; fix a bug in qst; more efficient coding 
of dmsn and dmst; pmsn can now be called with argument 'x' of matrix type; 
in pst and qst, new argument method allows to select the algorithm employed.
More detailed documentation of pst and other functions and methods.

Version 1.0-0 (2014-01-06)
This is a major upgrade of the package, with much of the code completely new 
or largely re-written, leading to changes in the syntax and the user interface.
The key new functions are selm and makeSECdistr, with various related functions
and methods. S4 methods are adopted. Many existing functions are updated, 
a few are dropped; see help(SN) for more information.

(Development of "version 1" is started in June 2007.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.4-1 to 0.4-18 (2007-2013)
Various minor adjustments, many of them to fulfill CRAN programming standards
  
Version 0.4-0 (2006-04-11)
Several changes and additions are included:
  - many routines allow use of composite parameter 'dp'  
  - multivariate normal and t probabilities are now computed by 'mnormt'
  - use of NAMESPACE introduced
  - some more routines introduced, eg. st.cumulants.inversion
  - various fixes/improvements in documentation

Version 0.3x (2003--2005)
Added some new functions (these include msn.affine, sn.mmle, sn.Einfo, 
sn.mle.grouped), fix various errors, and other improvements (eg. improved pst)

Version 0.30 (2002-06-15)
The main change is the addition of routines for (multivariate) skew-t 
distribution; also some other routines, e.g. mle for grouped data

Version 0.22.2 (2002-01-05)
Fix error in sn.dev.gh, improved qsn

Version 0.22.1 (2001-05-17)
         
Version 0.20 (Oct.1998):
This is the first public release and distribution via WWW
