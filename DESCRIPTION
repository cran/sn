Description: Build and manipulate probability distributions of the skew-normal 
  family and some related ones, notably the skew-t and the SUN families. 
  For the skew-normal and the skew-t distributions, statistical methods are 
  provided for data fitting and model diagnostics, in the univariate and the 
  multivariate case.
